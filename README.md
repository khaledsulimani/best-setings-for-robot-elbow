## 📐 Print Orientation
- **🔄 Recommended:** Print with the U-opening facing up
- **💡 Reason:** Minimizes support material and ensures strong layer adhesion for screw holes
- **🌳 Support:** Tree supports only where necessary for overhangs

## 🛠️ Post-Processing
1. **✂️ Support Removal:** Carefully remove tree supports with flush cutters
2. **🕳️ Hole Cleanup:** Use appropriate drill bits to clean screw holes if needed
3. **🔍 Test Fit:** Check motor fitment before final assembly
4. **🔧 Thread Preparation:** Use tap and die set if threaded holes are required

## 🔩 Assembly Notes (2kg Load Specifications)
- **⚙️ Motor Mounting:** Ensure motor fits snugly in the bracket cavity
- **🔩 Screw Specifications:** **M4 or M5 screws recommended** for 2kg loads (minimum 12mm length)
